The lookup files in .json format and the binary file in spaCy .bin format
were produced by Giovanni Toffoli to be exploited by a POS-aware lemmatizer
that he developed for spaCy, following an approach inspired by the Polish lemmatizer.

The list of Italian lemmas with POS tags was extracted from the morphological lexicon
morph-it, version 48, by Marco Baroni and Eros Zanchetta:
https://docs.sslmit.unibo.it/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=resources:morph-it.tgz
A small amount of lemmas in the binary file are still taken from the lookup file
it_lemma_lookup.json, already present in version 3.0.0 of the Italian language models.

The copyright, licence and credits information below was copied on May 2021
from the morph-it documentation at 
https://docs.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=resources:morph-it
Moreover, on May 2021 Giovanni Toffoli got from Marco Baroni, the main morph-it developer,
this written statement:
"non ho problemi riguardo all'idea che morph-it venga incorporato in un tool open source"
(I have no objection to morph-it being incorporated into an open source tool).

CREDITS

The main data source for the Morph-it! lexicon was the “la Repubblica” corpus. Thus, we would like to thank the colleagues who developed this resource with us: Lorenzo Piccioni, Guy Aston, Silvia Bernardini, Federica Comastri, Alessandra Volpi and Marco Mazzoleni.

We would like to thank the developers of the tools we used to tag, lemmatize and index the Repubblica corpus: the (Italian) TreeTagger (Helmut Schmid, Achim Stein), the ACOPOST taggers (Ingo Schroeder) and the IMS Corpus WorkBench (Oli Christ, Arne Fitschen and Stefan Evert).

Thanks to Helmut Schmid also for converting the Morph-it! lexicon into a SFST transducer.

We would like to thank Aldo Calpini</a>, who developed the perl module Lingua:IT:Conjugate.

We are also very grateful to Jan Daciuk for creating his finite-state utilities and for helping us learn to use them.

Finally, a big thanks to the members of the FoLUG, SannioLUG and Scuola (software libero nella scuola) mailing lists, for advice about licensing and dissemination.
